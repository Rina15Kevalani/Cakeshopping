              <strong>Fresh, moist cupcakes!</strong> <br>
             " I was gifted a box of four cupcakes for my birthday a few weeks ago from a loved one,
              and they were all delightful. The box included Sâ€™Mores, the Elvis, Lemon Bliss, and Chocolate Caramel. Out of the four, my favorite was the Elvis (that peanut butter mousse with bacon bits on top was amazing!) I definitely want to try their red velvet line and different types of chocolate cupcakes next time. Definitely keep them cool because the mousse did melt quite a bit.
              However, they were really cute, super fresh, and not too overwhelmingly sweet."
